When it's clear that Joe\nis dying, Mike visits him every day. One day Mike says, \"Joe, we have both\nloved football all our lives, and we played football on Saturdays together for so\nmany years. Please do me one favor, when you get to Heaven, somehow you\nmust let me know if there's football there.\"\n\nJoe looks up at Mike from his death bed. \"Mike, you have been my best friend\nfor many years.  If it's at all possible, I'll do this favor for you.\" Shortly after\nthat, Joe passes on.\nAt midnight a couple of nights later, Mike is awakened from a sound sleep by a\nblinding flash of white light and a voice calling out to him.\n\n\"Mike-Mike.\"\\n\n\"Who is it?\" asks Mike sitting up suddenly. \"Who is it?\"\\n\n\"Mike-it's me, Joe.\"\\n\n\"You're not Joe.  Joe just died.\"\\n\n\"I'm telling you, it's me, Joe,\" insists the voice.\\n\n\"Joe! Where are you?\"\\n\n\"In heaven,\" replies Joe.\\n\n\"I have some really good news and a little bad news.\\n\n\"Tell me the good news first,\" says Mike.\\n\n\"The good news,\" Joe says, \"is that there's football in heaven. Better yet, all of old friends who died before us are here, too. Better than that, we're all young again. Better still, it's always spring time and it never rains or snows. And best of all, we can play football all we want, and we never get tired.\"\\n\n\"That's fantastic,\" says Mike.\\n\n\"It's beyond my wildest dreams! So what's the bad news?\"\\n\n\"You're on the team for this Saturday's match!\"\n$$"}
